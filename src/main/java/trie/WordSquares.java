/**
 * 425. Word Squares
 * Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.
 *
 * A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string,
 * where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).
 *
 * For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads
 * the same both horizontally and vertically.
 *
 * b a l l
 * a r e a
 * l e a d
 * l a d y
 * Note:
 * There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
 * All words will have the exact same length.
 * Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
 * Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
 *
 * Output:
 * [
 *   [ "wall",
 *     "area",
 *     "lead",
 *     "lady"
 *   ],
 *   [ "ball",
 *     "area",
 *     "lead",
 *     "lady"
 *   ]
 * ]
 *
 * Explanation:
 * The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter
 * (just the order of words in each word square matters).

     * This is a very clever implementation.
     * For a word square : the letters in the square must be symmetric around the center.
     * the logic is that you build a word prefix based on letters in a list of words at a given index denoted by index
     * in the array. use a trie to get list of words that match the prefix.
     * for each word that matches , repeat the above via including that word in the list to be searched (backtrack)
     *
     * i,e words (ball, area, lead, lady)
     * start with : ball at index 1
     * 1st call get area as it starts with prefix a (constructed via ball's first index)
     * 2nd call get lead as it starts with prefix le (constructed via ball and area second index)
     * 3rd call get lady as it starts with prefix lad (constructed via ball, area and lead's third index)
