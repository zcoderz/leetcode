I have solved here several hundred coding questions where the source of the questions has been leetcode. 

The source of questions has been top questions across organizations and in addition top questions 
specifically by google, facebook and amazon. In addition, I have included questions that are good practice 
per the topic (graphs, trees, trie, dynamic programming and others).

The questions are organized by topic (graph, hash_maps, trees, trie,…). And in addition, by company (google, facebook & amazon). 
The questions are further classified as either hard or medium.

In addition, I have further classified the questions as:
-	IMP-1: These questions are extremely important to practice and are classified as such because they are good practice for a pattern of questions that repeats or are just very commonly asked.
-	IMP-2: These are also important but less than IMP-1.
-	IMP-3: Similarly, these are important but less than IMP-2.

For many of the questions I have coded several solutions and explained in comments pros and cons of various solutions. 
I have also included inline comments of the coding solutions. 
Each question also has reference to the source leet-code question including the question’s unique number.

See my website : https://www.uqcodewall.com/ where for 100 important questions I have explained the solution in 
 simple english. Hope you will find the explanation there straightforward.
